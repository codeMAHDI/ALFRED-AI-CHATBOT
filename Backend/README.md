# Alfred - AI Dating Concierge (Backend)

## Overview

The backend of **Alfred - AI Dating Concierge** is built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.

The backend acts as the central business layer of the application. It is responsible for authentication, user management, subscriptions, conversation history, AI integration, scheduling, notifications, and all database operations.

The AI service itself is completely **stateless** and does not directly communicate with the mobile application. Instead, the backend works as a middleware between the frontend and the AI service.

# Local Development

These commands are intended for day-to-day backend development on Windows from the VS Code terminal.

## 1. Setup

From the repository root:

```powershell
cd Backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create or update `Backend/.env`. At minimum for local development:

```env
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.10.28.178
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Use your own LAN IP in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` if another device or collaborator needs to access the backend from the same network.

## 2. Database

Run migrations:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

Create an admin user:

```powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Check the project:

```powershell
python manage.py check
```

Run tests:

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

## 3. Start The Full Dev Stack

Use the helper script:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-dev.cmd
```

This starts:

- Redis, if `redis-server` is available in `PATH`
- Daphne ASGI server on `0.0.0.0:8888`
- Celery worker
- Celery beat

Open Swagger:

```text
http://localhost:8888/api/docs/
```

For another device on the same network, use your LAN IP:

```text
http://10.10.28.178:8888/api/docs/
```

The server must be running on `0.0.0.0`, and the LAN IP must be included in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

## 4. Stop The Dev Stack

```powershell
.\scripts\stop-dev.cmd
```

The script stops the processes it started using PID records stored in:

```text
Backend/.runtime/
```

This folder is ignored by git.

## 5. Useful Start Options

Run on another port:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-dev.cmd -Port 8899
```

Skip Redis if it is already running separately:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-dev.cmd -SkipRedis
```

View logs:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\.runtime\logs
Get-Content .\.runtime\logs\asgi.err.log -Tail 100
Get-Content .\.runtime\logs\celery-worker.err.log -Tail 100
Get-Content .\.runtime\logs\celery-beat.err.log -Tail 100
```

## 6. Redis Notes

For local Windows development without Docker, Redis should usually be reachable at:

```text
redis://localhost:6379
```

If `redis-server` is not installed or not available in `PATH`, start Redis manually and then run:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-dev.cmd -SkipRedis
```

When Docker Compose is added later, `REDIS_HOST=redis` will be correct inside containers. For local Windows scripts, use `REDIS_HOST=localhost`.

## 7. Manual Fallback Commands

If you ever want to run each process manually in separate terminals:

Terminal 1:

```powershell
redis-server --port 6379
```

Terminal 2:

```powershell
python -m daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8888 core.asgi:application
```

Terminal 3:

```powershell
python -m celery -A core worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo
```

Terminal 4:

```powershell
python -m celery -A core beat --loglevel=info
```

# Architecture

The backend follows a **feature-based architecture**.

```

│
├── core/
│
├── apps/
│   ├── users/
│   ├── authentication/
│   ├── chat/
│   ├── ai_gateway/

│   ├── calendar/
│   ├── notifications/
│   ├── subscriptions/

Each application owns its own models, serializers, services, permissions, views, urls, tasks and business logic.

# Backend Responsibilities

The backend is responsible for:

- User authentication
- JWT authorization
- User profile management
- Onboarding
- AI request validation
- Calling AI APIs
- Persisting AI responses
- Conversation history
- WebSocket communication
- Date plans
- Calendar events
- Notifications
- Subscription validation
- API documentation
- Business rules

The backend **does not contain AI logic**.

---

# AI Integration

The AI service is designed to be **stateless**.

The backend is the source of truth.

```
User

↓

Flutter

↓

Backend

↓

Load Conversation

↓

Prepare Context

↓

Call AI

↓

Receive Response

↓

Save Response

↓

Return to Client
```

The AI service never directly accesses the database.

---

# Real-Time Communication

Since Alfred is primarily a **voice assistant**, real-time communication is implemented using **WebSockets (Django Channels)**.

WebSockets will be used for:

- Live conversations
- Voice sessions
- Streaming AI responses
- Typing indicators
- Future real-time notifications

Standard CRUD operations continue to use REST APIs.

---

# Core Features

## User

Stores:

- Basic account information
- Profile
- Preferences
- Subscription state
- Authentication provider
- Device token
- Email Login
- Registration
- Password Reset
- Email Verification
- JWT Authentication
- Google Login (future)
- Apple Login (future)

---

## Chat

Responsible for:

- Conversations
- Messages
- Voice sessions
- Chat history
- WebSocket consumers

Every conversation is stored permanently inside PostgreSQL.

---

## AI Gateway

The AI Gateway communicates with the FastAPI service.

Responsibilities:

- Prepare AI requests
- Pass conversation history
- Receive AI responses
- Handle failures
- Return structured data

No AI logic exists inside Django.

---

## Plans

Stores AI-generated or manually created date plans.

Users can:

- Save plans
- Edit plans
- Delete plans
- View history
- View upcoming plans

---

## Calendar

Responsible for scheduling.

Supports:

- Upcoming events
- Date reminders
- Future Google Calendar integration

---

## Notifications

Responsible for:

- In-app notifications
- Reminder scheduling

---

## Subscriptions

Responsible for:

- Premium validation
- Subscription status
- Future payment integration

The initial MVP stores the current subscription state inside the `User` model for quick authorization checks.

A dedicated `UserSubscription` model will be introduced during payment implementation to manage subscription history, provider transactions, renewals, and billing logic while keeping the `User` model synchronized with the current active subscription.

---

# Admin Dashboard (Planned)

An internal React-based admin dashboard will be developed for administrators to manage the platform.

## Authentication

- Admin Login

## Notifications

- View Notifications
- Mark Notifications as Read

## General Features

- Server-side Pagination
- Searching
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Secure Admin Permissions
- Role-based Access Control (Future)
